# Doctor Appointment Booking System

This project is a web-based platform that allows users to book doctor appointments online by selecting available time slots. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), the system provides a seamless experience for both patients and doctors. The website includes multiple pages, such as the home page, about us, doctor search, doctor profile, and patient profile. Patients can create a profile to store their personal details and medical history, search for doctors based on specialty, and book available appointment slots.

Doctors also have profiles that display their information, availability, and booked appointments. MongoDB is used as the database to store information about patients, doctors, and appointments, ensuring efficient data management. The platform enhances the accessibility and convenience of healthcare appointments by providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
